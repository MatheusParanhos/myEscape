my escape app currently under development with react-native.

To run this project clone, yarn it and react-native link
thanks!

OBS: After I've added `react-native-scrollable-tab-view` to the project, there is a small
bug on this package after react-native upgraded. So in order to run this project you will
have to go to node_modules/react-native-scrollable-tab-view/SceneComponent.js and take the trailing commas out. This issue is probably going to be fixed soon on the `npm package` Thanks!
